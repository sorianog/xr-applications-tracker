- [StreamSDK - formerly "Video Chat"](http://www.streamsdk.com/)  
  "This is a drag-drop, cross-platform, no-latency, streaming/sharing solution for Unity XR/AR/VR and anything else Unity can render. The use cases are endless.  
  A big challenge with XR/AR/VR is collaborating amongst various audiences from within these new experiences in real-time, with no latency, on any device, from anywhere in the world.  
  We make it easy by allowing developers to stream audio, video, and input just by dragging in a few prefabs.  
  The shortest distance between two ideas.â„¢" - Jeremy
